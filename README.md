The program, run_analysis.R, reads several files generated by the UCI Machine Learning Respository.  The goal of this program is to transform the data on the respository into a tidy dataset.  

This program performs the following steps:

1.  Set the working directory where the data files are located
2.  Read the train data, train labels, test labels and test data 
3.  Read the features file to get the feature variable names
4.  Read the activity labels file to get the name of the activities that were measured
5.  Change the first variable name to "labels", so the variable name is unique from the other variable names
6.  Merge the train and test dataset based on the variable names of the train and test dataset
7.  change the variables names to the names found in the features file
8.  Extract the measurements that were either the mean or standard deviation of measurement using wildcard searches and the grepl command
9.  Create an empty dataset to populate the tidy dataset
10. Calculate the column means for each activity label by first subsetting the dataset based on activity and storing the means in a temporary dataset 
11. Once the column means is calculated, the temporary dataset is combined with the empty dataset
12. The resulting tidy dataset is written to a text file
